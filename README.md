# Capstone Project 1

## Description

This project is a website for the CC Global Summit 2015, an event that brings together creative minds from different fields to share their ideas and insights on various topics. The website consists of two pages: the home page and the about page.

I built this project as part of the Microverse program to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project also follows basic [design guidelines](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) provided by [Cindy Shin](https://www.behance.net/adagio07), the original designer.

The main features of this project are:

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop screens
- Dynamic creation of the featured speakers section using JavaScript
- Interactive menu for mobile devices
- Smooth scrolling and navigation
